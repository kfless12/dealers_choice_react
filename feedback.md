Great job, Kevin! It isnt good practice to mix native html methods like `document.getElementById`, `document.createElement()` and `classList.add()` or `classList.remove()` with React. How would you refactor so that React is doing all the work of manipulating the DOM for you? Or if you don't want to refactor code you didnt write (although its great practice for real life experiences), you could find implementations of these games using react. Here's an example: https://github.com/xfhg/blackjackin. (though this is quite outdated and there are probably much more recent examples you could use)
